So new you knew we're new.
We launched our app and wanted to share what we're all about.

<div class="post">
<p>Today we&#39;re launching a product we think you&#39;ll really love.  We built it because
we spent so much time setting our development environments up to be able to
test mobile platforms and API integrations that we wanted to simplify that
process.</p>

<p>Now, granted, there are other tools out there that we have discovered in the
process of building Portly that help with the tasks we first intended for Portly,
but our idea took a shape of its own.  We went native.</p>

<p>In our eyes, a native Mac app was the only real way to simplify development.  We
didn&#39;t want to have to run several dedicated tabs in our console. We didn&#39;t want to
have to deal with variable URLs. We didn&#39;t want to have to deal with connections
timing out from inactivity.</p>

<p>Really, we just wanted to be able to set it up once, click a couple buttons,
and be able to spend all day or week or month without thinking about it again.
So that&#39;s what we built.</p>

<p>In the process, we found ourselves using Portly for <a href="http://pssh.me">remote pairing</a>,
collaborating, and even using it to grab files on our computer while we&#39;re away.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve found a use (or have a need) for Portly, let us know! We&#39;re here and
listening, we&#39;ve got plenty more to share, and we want to hear your feedback.</p>
