<p>We just launched a new feature this week that really helps for those of you
who want to keep your website available for long periods of time, even when
you&#39;re away from your computer.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a new setting in the app that prevents
your computer from going to sleep when a port is active.  Since it&#39;s a smart
feature, it won&#39;t keep your computer from sleeping when you shut the lid of
your laptop or force sleep mode.</p>

<p>All right, now that we&#39;ve thoroughly tested it, it&#39;s <a href="http://rd.io/x/QUhXKDeqvmg/">3am and I want to go
to bed</a>.</p>
