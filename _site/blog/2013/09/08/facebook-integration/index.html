Facebook integration in development.
Integrating Facebook with your development server is super easy with Portly.
<h2 class="text-center margin-bottom-30">Facebook integration in development.</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>So many of our sites integrate the use of Facebook&#39;s authentication or
Open Graph tags now, but it&#39;s not entirely easy to test those features of a site
before they&#39;re out in the wild. Well, it <strong>wasn&#39;t</strong> easy, but now it is.</p>

<p>Testing Facebook integration in development means you&#39;ll need to create your own
app in Facebook just for your setup.  Just head to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps">the app page</a> and
add a new app.  If you haven&#39;t created your app for your live server, make that
one first. Select your use, and put in your domain/URL for your production server.</p>

<p>Then create another app to use on your development server.  We generally
name ours the same as the live one with our name in parentheses, like <strong>Portly (Donuteater)</strong>.
For the domain, put <code>your-subdomain.portly.co</code> or your respective domain
for development.  If you&#39;re using Facebook for authentication, select &quot;Website with
Facebook Login&quot; and put in your site URL for your Portly site (you can copy the link
from the app). Just leave the development one in Sandbox mode so you&#39;re not spamming
all your friends with test data.</p>

<p>So you should have two apps now&mdash;one for production, and one for development. Now
it&#39;s time to set up your app.</p>

<p>In your Devise setup, use something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">config.omniauth :facebook,
                ENV[&#39;FB_APP_ID&#39;] || Rails.configuration.facebook_app_id,
                ENV[&#39;FB_APP_SECRET&#39;] || Rails.configuration.facebook_secret,
                :strategy_class =&gt; OmniAuth::Strategies::Facebook,
                :scope =&gt; &#39;email&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>We like to use environment variables in development to allow our team to set up
their own custom environment without modifying code or config files. You can set
these environment variables in your <code>.bashrc</code> file, or you can
use <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman">foreman</a> and set your environment using an <code>.env</code> file.</p>

<p>Now when you try to sign into Facebook from <code>your-subdomain.portly.co</code>,
Facebook will recognize your App ID and secret and the associated domain and
grant you access to your site.</p>
