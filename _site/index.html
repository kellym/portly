  <h2 class="text-center margin-bottom-30"><a href="/blog/2013/09/08/facebook-integration/">Facebook integration in development.</a></h2>
  <div class="content margin-bottom-50">
<p>So many of our sites integrate the use of Facebook&#39;s authentication or
Open Graph tags now, but it&#39;s not entirely easy to test those features of a site
before they&#39;re out in the wild. Well, it <strong>wasn&#39;t</strong> easy, but now it is.</p>

<p>Testing Facebook integration in development means you&#39;ll need to create your own
app in Facebook just for your setup.  Just head to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps">the app page</a> and
add a new app.  If you haven&#39;t created your app for your live server, make that
one first. Select your use, and put in your domain/URL for your production server.</p>

<p>Then create another app to use on your development server.  We generally
name ours the same as the live one with our name in parentheses, like <strong>Portly (Donuteater)</strong>.
For the domain, put <code>your-subdomain.portly.co</code> or your respective domain
for development.  If you&#39;re using Facebook for authentication, select &quot;Website with
Facebook Login&quot; and put in your site URL for your Portly site (you can copy the link
from the app). Just leave the development one in Sandbox mode so you&#39;re not spamming
all your friends with test data.</p>

<p>So you should have two apps now&mdash;one for production, and one for development. Now
it&#39;s time to set up your app.</p>

<p>In your Devise setup, use something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">config.omniauth :facebook,
                ENV[&#39;FB_APP_ID&#39;] || Rails.configuration.facebook_app_id,
                ENV[&#39;FB_APP_SECRET&#39;] || Rails.configuration.facebook_secret,
                :strategy_class =&gt; OmniAuth::Strategies::Facebook,
                :scope =&gt; &#39;email&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>We like to use environment variables in development to allow our team to set up
their own custom environment without modifying code or config files. You can set
these environment variables in your <code>.bashrc</code> file, or you can
use <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman">foreman</a> and set your environment using an <code>.env</code> file.</p>

<p>Now when you try to sign into Facebook from <code>your-subdomain.portly.co</code>,
Facebook will recognize your App ID and secret and the associated domain and
grant you access to your site.</p>

<p>We just launched a new feature this week that really helps for those of you
who want to keep your website available for long periods of time, even when
you&#39;re away from your computer.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a new setting in the app that prevents
your computer from going to sleep when a port is active.  Since it&#39;s a smart
feature, it won&#39;t keep your computer from sleeping when you shut the lid of
your laptop or force sleep mode.</p>

<p>All right, now that we&#39;ve thoroughly tested it, it&#39;s <a href="http://rd.io/x/QUhXKDeqvmg/">3am and I want to go
to bed</a>.</p>

<p>Today we&#39;re launching a product we think you&#39;ll really love.  We built it because
we spent so much time setting our development environments up to be able to
test mobile platforms and API integrations that we wanted to simplify that
process.</p>

<p>Now, granted, there are other tools out there that we have discovered in the
process of building Portly that help with the tasks we first intended for Portly,
but our idea took a shape of its own.  We went native.</p>

<p>In our eyes, a native Mac app was the only real way to simplify development.  We
didn&#39;t want to have to run several dedicated tabs in our console. We didn&#39;t want to
have to deal with variable URLs. We didn&#39;t want to have to deal with connections
timing out from inactivity.</p>

<p>Really, we just wanted to be able to set it up once, click a couple buttons,
and be able to spend all day or week or month without thinking about it again.
So that&#39;s what we built.</p>

<p>In the process, we found ourselves using Portly for <a href="http://pssh.me">remote pairing</a>,
collaborating, and even using it to grab files on our computer while we&#39;re away.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve found a use (or have a need) for Portly, let us know! We&#39;re here and
listening, we&#39;ve got plenty more to share, and we want to hear your feedback.</p>
